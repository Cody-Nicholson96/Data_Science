#Velocity

Velocity is about the speed that the data arrives, ready to be processed

We need to know the velocity so we can make sure that we have enough space to store all the data without having to discard any of it (ALL DATA IS GOOD DATA)

We can then use the data to offer services that better fits consumers needs
