#Hadoop Ecosystem

The mapReduce software is built on top of the Hadoop distributed file system, and together MapReduce and HDFS make up the Core Hadoop

There are many more softwares that have grown up around Core Hadoop that we call the **Hadoop Ecosystem**

***

###Hive & Pig

Two of these softwares built around Core Hadoop are Hive and Pig

Hive and Pig make it easier to query the data that is collected without needing to do any coding

Hive takes SQL queries that you provide and changes those queries into mapReduce code which then runs on the cluster in HDFS

Hive is optimized for running long batch processing jobs

Pig is a fairly simple scripting language that allows you to write code to analyze your data rather than mapReduce. Like Hive, Pig changes your code into mapReduce code that is then run on the cluster

***

###Impala

Impala was developed as a way to query your data with SQL that directly accesses HDFS without using mapReduce

Impala is is optimized for low latency queries, meaning they run quickly, often many times faster than hive

***

###Sqoop & Flume

Sqoop takes data from a traditional relational database, like microsoft SQL server, and puts in in HDFS as delimited files so it can be processed along with other data on the cluster

Flume ingests data as its generated by external systems and puts it into the cluster

***

###HBase

HBase is a real-time database built on top of HDFS

***

####Hue is a graphical front-end to the cluster

####Oozie is a workflow management tool

####Mahout is a machine learning library

***

###Cloudera

Making all of these different ecosystem projects talk to one another and work well is often difficult

To make installing and maintaining a cluster with all these different ecosystem projects easier, **Cloudera** has put together a distribution of Hadoop called _**CDH**_ (Cloudera Distribution including apache Hadoop)

-

Cloudera takes all the key ecosystem projects along with Hadoop itself and packages them together so that installation is a really easy process

The components are all tested together so you can be sure that there are no incompatabilities between them
