# Intro to Data Mining

This course is about:

- Processing large amounts of data
- The relationship between data mining, data warehouse, and query tools
- Data preparation for the data mining process
- Model building, algorithms, and technology (Supervised learning(Classification and prediction(Decision trees & Bayesian)), Unsupervised learning(Clustering))
- Evaluation of the data mining model (comparisons of different data mining tools)
- Visualization using Data Mining

-

### Learning Goals

- Identify basic concepts, terminology, models, and methods in the field of data mining
- Develop and evaluate different data mining algorithms
- Apply data mining algorithms to large datasets
- Recommend designs of knowledge discovery systems for specific problems

***

When you have *labels* you can use **Supervised Learning**

When you do not have *labels*, you need to use **Unsupervised Learning**

***

Study how to study the data numerically

- Five number summary (Box plot)
- Mean and Standard Deviation (Histograms)
- Categorical Data (Pie charts, bar graphs)
- Two variable correlation (Scatterplot, Regression Analysis)
