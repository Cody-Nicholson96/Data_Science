Sorting Data:


Fields in the Rows and Columns categories can be sorted in ascending (A-Z) or descending (Z-A) order.

To change how data is sorted in your pivot table report, click the drop-down menu at the bottom of a field in the Rows or Columns category.
Then, select how you'd like to sort your data.



Summarizing Data:


Fields in the Values category can be sorted by functions like number, sum, and average.

To change how data is summarized in your pivot table report, click the drop-down menu at the bottom of the a field in the Values category.
Then, select how you'd like to summarise your data.

If the Values category contains more than one field, data can be displayed in either rows or columns.
Switch between row and column display by clicking the Columns drop-down menu at the top of the Values category.



Filtering Data:


Adding a field to the Filter category lets you hide data points that you don't want to show in your pivot table report.

To filter data in your pivot table report, click the drop-down menu at the bottom of a field in the Filter category.
Then, use the checkboxes in the drop-down menu to select the data points you want to show or hide in your pivot table report.



Use Formulas:


You can analyze your data even more by entering formulas outside of the borders of the pivot data report.
The formula will treat pivot table values as regular data cells, and can be dragged to expand across a row.

If you make changes to the source data spreadsheet after adding a formula, the pivot table report and formula results will update with new values.
