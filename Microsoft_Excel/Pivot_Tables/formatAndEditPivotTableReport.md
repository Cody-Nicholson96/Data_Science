After you build your pivot table report, you can go back at any time to format or edit your pivot table report



Editing the data range:


The fields listed in the Report Editor depend on the data range selected for your pivot table.
Each column header in the selected data range will appear as a field in the Report Editor.
To change the data range, follow these steps:

1. Click the edit range link the top of the Report Editor.

2. In the dialog that appears, type a new data range, or click the tab with the full data set and manually select a new range of cells.



Cell borders, colors, and fonts:


Pivot table reports have the same formatting options as the rest of your spreadsheet.
Here are some of the things you can do:

- Change font size
- Change font color
- Italicize, bold, or underline
- Align text
- Add borders to cells
- Use conditional formatting to change cell format based on customizable rules

Be sure to make all formatting changes after you're done adding and sorting fields.
Formatting changes, including conditional formatting, won't be applied to new cells in your pivot table report.

You can't change row and column headers in your report, as they are populated from the fields you've added to the Row and Column categories.
To make a change, go to your source spreadsheet and adjust the column header.
Doing so will change the titles of the corresponding fields in your pivot table report.

To paste your pivot table report into another spreadsheet or sheet tab, follow these steps:

1. Select the cells you want to copy from your pivot table report.

2. In the spreadsheet or sheet where you'd like to paste your report, select the top-left cell to paste these values.

3. From the Edit menu, select Paste values only.
